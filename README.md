# Robot Welding with Machine Vision and Lidar using OpenGL

## Overview

This project involves developing a robot control system using C++ and OpenGL. The system incorporates vision and lidar technologies to scan objects, visualize the results, and perform inspection tasks. The project includes functionalities for real-time object detection, lidar-based scanning, and interactive 3D visualization.

## Features

- **Vision System**: Utilizes computer vision techniques for object detection and recognition.
- **Lidar Integration**: Employs lidar sensors to scan the environment and generate 3D point clouds.
- **3D Visualization**: Implements OpenGL for real-time rendering of the robot's environment and scanned objects, [SSAA]
- **Robot Control**: Provides an interface for controlling the robot's movements and operations.
- **Inspection**: Includes tools for inspecting and analyzing scanned objects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequis


ites

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- **OpenGL**: Make sure OpenGL and related libraries (GLFW, GLAD) are installed.
- **OpenCV**: Required for the vision system.
- **Lidar SDK**: Install the SDK provided by your lidar sensor manufacturer.


## Usage

### Robot Control

- **Manual Control**: Use keyboard inputs to control the robot's movements.
- **Autonomous Mode**: Enable autonomous mode for automatic scanning and inspection.

### Vision System

- **Object Detection**: Uses OpenCV to detect and classify objects in real time.
- **Camera Calibration**: Includes tools for calibrating the camera for accurate measurements.

### Lidar Scanning

- **Real-time Scanning**: Continuously scans the environment to create a 3D map.
- **Point Cloud Processing**: Processes the point cloud data for visualization and analysis.

### 3D Visualization

- **Environment Rendering**: Renders the robot's environment using OpenGL.
- **Interactive Interface**: Allows users to interact with the 3D visualization (e.g., zoom, rotate).
